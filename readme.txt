The Gunner Technology OpenGrapher plugin allows WordPress admins to configure OpenGraph info for their site and add official badges with tracking.

== Description ==

OpenGrapher is based on [This Post](http://yoast.com/social-buttons/) by Yoast.

The plugin allows you to add the following official badges:

* Facebook Like/Send
* Twitter Tweet
* Google +1
* LinkedIn Share
* StumbleUpon's Stumble

Additionally, it will track clicks with Google Analytics and/or Clicky. It automatically detects if they're present.
